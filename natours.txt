1-    Users -----------------------> Reviews: (Parent Referencing. 1 to many Relationship between Users and Reviews.)
        1 to many relationship in between them.




2-    Tours ---------------------> Reviews: (Parent Referencing). 



3-    Tours <--------------------> Locations: Few to Few Relationship (A Version of Many to Many Relationship).
                                    Location inside tours and tours inside locatins. . . 



4-    Tours <---------------------> Users: (It is a few to few relationship.)
                                    Because: 1 tours can have few Tour Guides.
                                    1 Guide can be guiding few tours. (Reference or Embed can be used this case using mongoose.)



5-   Tours ------------------------> Bookings: 1 tour can have many bookings.



6-   Users ------------------------> Bookings: 1 user can have many bookings.




Lecture 150:

--GeoSpatial Data is what mongo db supports out of the box.
--It is supported by MongoDB out of the box.
--Location will be written in the tour model.
--We, in GeoJSON, first will write longitudes and later latitudes. [Number: Longitude, Number: Latitude];
--Start location is just an object now, but to create a document out inside a doc, it needs to be an array.
--Now the Jonas will delete the dev datas, and then import the latest data.

LECTURE: 151
--we are gonna embed user document into the tour document.
--When creating the tour document, the user will simply put the array of user ids.
--



 LECTURE: 152:
-- Now that we knew the drawbacks of embeeding, now we will reference the tour
 guides into the tour documents.
--THE MAIN CONCERN: Tours and Users will remain as completely separate entities in our DBs.
--We are gonna learn about REFERENCING in MONGOOSE actually. 
--We are gonna now make it as type:guides:[type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId];
--We are gonna make it as an array now (to treat it as a subdoc.);
--Now we will place user object id inside of an array.
-- like: ["fadsfadsf", "423sgfafdgad"];
--(Not done: Jonas making the array of uses and posting tours with references
        users and watching it in the compass).

LECTURE: 153:
--              populating the users.
--Since in tours, we wanted to populate Users, we  make a reference to it and then:
query.populate("users");
--watched upto (3:14 mins.)
--Now Jonas wanna push the query.populate("fieldName") thing into a query middleware.
--Because every single time otherwise we shall have to write .populate("field"),
        and also -_V and -_passwordChanged at to not show minus fields if we're only using populates.

        and also update everything in all routes for this effect to reflect
        everywhere.
        --SO HE JUS THAS SETUP --QUERY MIDDLEWARES -- THAT'S ABOUT IT. 


LECTURE NUMBER: 154

//We want a review, rating and created at, and we would also want a reference to the tour that this review belongs 
to and also the user who wrote this review.  Basucally 2 parent references in here.
--we made a reviewSchema and then we linked our reviews with user and tour. Then we used virtuals: true and 
        tovirtuals: true and we also formed some of key value pairs inside of the reviewModel.

LECTURE NUMBER: 155
--We created the review contreoller, and  wrote a review by signing up and logging in one user and using 
his _id with tour's _id. Now we will populate in lecture: 156.

LECTURE NUMBER: 156
--This time we are gonna populate reviews both by tour data and the user data. 
--We will chain populate method twice.
--2 populates will query db twice.
--took 23 mss my case for 2 db operations.
--Completed the population
--BUG (series of inclusions and exclusion error for --durationWeeks-- for some reason.);

LECTURE NUMBERE 157
--There is a detailed explaination in the video itself, on what needs to be done you know.
--There is a convention for virtual populate now.
--Without  actually persisting it into the DB, we store the array of IDs of reviews in tours collection.

LECTURE NUMBER 158
--In the real world, the user id should come from the currently logged in user.
--We would wanna make a request for the post, reviews,
--we will follow the pattern for: /tour/tourObjectId123/reviews/reviewsObjectId (POST/GET REQUESTS).
--we are now gonna implement the nested route as shown as above.
--we will now implement it right away starting from the tour routes.
-- 

LECTURE NUMBER 159
--In here now we are gonna implement the nested routes in express.
--In 158, what we did is we created a route the way: (POST): tours/tourId/reviews.
--Here we gave tourId in params, used the tourId and then imported the reviewController in tourRouter.
--We then created a review out of tourId and UserId.
--Basically in tour router, we had to import the review controller.
--Now one thing to remember, we can create reviews in 2 ways: Being on Review Router, or by being on tour router.
--We will have duplicate codes, if in case we wanna change anything.
--We are now gonna learn about MERGE PARAMS in Express.
--For the separation of concerns, we will now remove the piece of code that creates reviews from the 
 tourRouter.
--So this way --> import statement of reviewController <-- too is unnecessary.
--Now Jonas Imports the reviewRouter inside of the tourRouter to connect between 2 routers (not controllers.)
--BASICALLY FIRST EVER USE OF (ROUTER.USE('/:tourId/reviews', reviewRouter));
--Since now we are redirected to the reviewRouter, reviewRouter will nowhere know about the tourId when referred.
--We will now incoorporate mergeParams.
--We will now in --reviewRouter do: const router = express.Router({mergeParams: true});

                WhAt DiD nOt WoRk TiLl NoW:
a) Reviews: -> always [] after successfully creating reviwes. (skipped as it took lots of time, will come back later.)

LECTURE NUMBER 160
--ADDING A NESTED GET ENDPOINT --
--ADDED

LECTURE NUMBER 161
--we added up some factory functions for delete. . . 
--past 3 mins left to watch.
--Delets a user too (of course)

LECTURE NUMBER 162
--Creating a factory function for -updating- and -deleting-
--Update: The patch functionality have been embedded in all the controllers, -review, tour and user controller.
-- Implemented Update:
--Implementing Create Handler (testing left):
--slightly confused on implementation for creation of reviews as reviews are created in tour via user.
--In creation for reviews, jonas makes up a new middleware function and he will inject
  that middleware function into the reviewrouter, that will possibly remove the hurdle of checking up of
  the req.body.user and req.body.tourId are either non existent, if not existent for sure
  then, that middleware fn would set it in the body for creation of reviews.
--Required checking the valid Object IDs and all in my case.
--checking in postman is left. (***********POSTMAN THINGS ARE STILL LEFT TO BE DONE ***********)
--

LECTURE NUMBER 163
--Implementing the getOne router handler.
--Instead for us for having just getting a data, we sometimes have a populate options.
--const doc  = await Model.findById(req.params.id).populate('reviews');
--All completed for get One


LECTURE NUMBER 164
--adding a /me endpoiont.
--for a /me endpoint, we will need: we will need to watch a id from the req.user;
--Here we will fake it as if id is coming in request params. 
--Other implementation would be similar to getting a user.
--Here what we did was we injected a middleware before the /specificUserId 
  middleware. And if a user visits /me then, we will programatically put the UserId
  in the params of the logged in user. and boom. It works.

LECTURE NUMBER 165
--Here we will add up the missing authorisation and authentication for any user.
--It is done in Router Basically.
--Jonas Protects some of routes using ROuter.use() method of express.
--Configures RBACs on some of routes on 3 different resources.
--Chapter ends here.

LECTURE NUMBER 166
--We basically imported some of resources into our DB from the file system.
--Imported tours, reviews and users resources.

LECTURE NUMBER 167
--We are now improving the read preformances of the Database with indexes.
--Will do create some Indexes later.
--(❌❌)

LECTURE NUMBER 168
--Removing the constant queries of the related data sets.
--When a review will be created, we will find the way to update tour.
--We will be able to show up number of ratings and average of all the ratings.
--We never ever calculated average ratings quite before, Now that we will calculate it when a review is created or deleted.
--Using reviewModel, we create a function in review model, and using the fn, we will calculate the average of the tours there.
-- The function will at the end update the tour document too.
--We will make a  middleware that will keep track of all the documents.
--


LECTURE NUMBER 169
--(findByIdAndUpdate & findByIdAndDelete), Now we are gonna update the reviews upon update and delete.
--Fragments of documentsa are obtained by Find+Update or Find+Delete methods, so we won't be able to run the 
  ReviewCalculation method as above.
-- Testing is left for this one - whether our implementation of handling the ratingsAverage
   would work or not. (❌❌)
--(Did not work on update and delete.);
--Need to rethink again.

LECTURE NUMBER 170
--We are gonna use a simple trick to  let users not write more than one review for each tour.
--Each User can review one tour and that too only once.
--Since the new objectId made by combination of user and posts have been made unique.
--(❌❌)

LECTURE NUMBER 171
--We are gonna learn about geospatial queries.
--Helps users search for tours in a specific points.
--Distance would be of any miles say 250 mi.
--I can being in Nepal, search for tours based within Nepal.
--used some of geospatial queries now.
--will use somewhere or sometime.
--used $geoWithin and $centerSphere mongo operators now.
--discovered Bunch others in their site.

LECTURE NUMBER 172
--Here we will discover about the distances between start location and the point where tour is located.
--We will use a $geoNear aggregation.
--This requires one of the key to be indexed for using geoNear.
--We index: startlocation:'2dSphere'. It is mandatory.
--Implemented totally.



LECTURE NUMBER 173
--Creating the API Documentation for our APIs.
--We will now manage the passwords in a variables. (--More to watch later--).
--More to be done later.

//*********************SERVER SIDE RENDERING ********************************//
//**************************************************************************//

LECTURE NUMBER 175
--We are now gonna implement the server side rendering in our project.
--We can now log in and sign up in here.
--We can see all the reviews of the users and we can also open up the personal user account.
--We can also check all the bookings of the user.
--We will implement the maps into our project too.


LECTURE NUMBER 176
--This deals about setting up the pug templates and working with it.
--We can easily fill out the template and fill up the data using pug.
--There are couple of other templating engines too available like handlebars or ejs.
--Pugs are also called Views in Express because they are views in MVC Architecture.
--Now we will create up a views folder.
--Now we set view engiene to -pug and so on and so forth.
--We now have created everything for our pug things.
--Now inside pug, we are gonna create -base.pug & then check if it will work. . . 
--

LECTURE NUMBER 177
--Now we are gonna implement a pug in our code.
--The variables that we will pass inside the pug's data as: .render('base', {key:value //This is called locals});
--To show locals we follow the syntax: p1= key; value of the key will be rendered automatically.
--Each assest confirms it's own HTTP request.
--so in favicon, there's img/favicon.png, so how does it work?
--It works by It's own GET request being fired.
--Now we're gonna see how we can send data to the pug templates.
--We can create comments now. . . And the thing is that we can create 2 kinds of comments. 
-- We can embed JS in our code:   Eg: h2= message.toUpperCase();
--Unbuffered code are code that's not gonna add anything to the output.
        
        Eg: -const x = 9;
             h2 = 2 * x;

             p This is just some text.
--We did some computations. We will now convert our Starter HTML file into pug template.



LECTURE NUMBER 178
-- Including the file i.e one template to an another template now.
--done

LECTURE NUMBER 179
--This was all about including the files into the main pug file.
--Syntax: include pugFileName.pug

LECTURE NUMBER 180:
--This lecture is all about using -extends-. Using which we can use the same base layout for all the pages.
--We can extend one pug to an another Can be applied to every single page we can render.
--we made a overview page render route.
--We would also want a route to /tour, so we made it.
--Base template is the parent template and this process is also called extending.
--Now in the overview page, it will extend the base template.
--Understood the differences betweeen extends and includes.
--The base template if is extended on the child template, then parent bases' 


LECTURE NUMBER 181
--Just with the resources, we are gonna create controller for the views.
--181 has come to an end with me building some routes for our views.

LECTURE NUMBER 182
--Now we're building the tours overview page.
--we made upto showing up 9 tours but data shown are not dymamic even now. (NOT DONE IN THE PRACTICE)

LECTURE NUMBER 183
--Here now we are going to
