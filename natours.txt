1-    Users -----------------------> Reviews: (Parent Referencing. 1 to many Relationship between Users and Reviews.)
        1 to many relationship in between them.




2-    Tours ---------------------> Reviews: (Parent Referencing). 



3-    Tours <--------------------> Locations: Few to Few Relationship (A Version of Many to Many Relationship).
                                    Location inside tours and tours inside locatins. . . 



4-    Tours <---------------------> Users: (It is a few to few relationship.)
                                    Because: 1 tours can have few Tour Guides.
                                    1 Guide can be guiding few tours. (Reference or Embed can be used this case using mongoose.)



5-   Tours ------------------------> Bookings: 1 tour can have many bookings.

Lecture 150:

--GeoSpatial Data is what mongo db supports out of the box.
--It is supported by MongoDB out of the box.
--Location will be written in the tour model.
--We, in GeoJSON, first will write longitudes and later latitudes. [Number: Longitude, Number: Latitude];
--Start location is just an object now, but to create a document out inside a doc, it needs to be an array.
--Now the Jonas will delete the dev datas, and then import the latest data.

LECTURE: 151
--we are gonna embed user document into the tour document.
--When creating the tour document, the user will simply put the array of user ids.
--



 LECTURE: 152:
-- Now that we knew the drawbacks of embeeding, now we will reference the tour
 guides into the tour documents.
--THE MAIN CONCERN: Tours and Users will remain as completely separate entities in our DBs.
--We are gonna learn about REFERENCING in mongoose actually. 
--We are gonna now make it as type:guides:[type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId];
--We are gonna make it as an array now.
